    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) reduces overfitting in decision trees by combining multiple trees, each trained on a different bootstrap sample of the original dataset. Overfitting happens when a model captures noise instead of the underlying pattern. In decision trees, overfitting is a common issue as they tend to capture even the smallest variations in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By aggregating the predictions of many overfitted trees, bagging averages out their errors and noise, leading to a more generalized and robust model. This averaging process smooths out the high variance and reduces the overfitting that individual decision trees might exhibit"
