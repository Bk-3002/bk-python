    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions. Each node in the tree represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the class label.\n",

    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Node: The process starts at the root node, which contains the entire dataset.\n",
    "Splitting: At each node, the algorithm selects the best feature and threshold to split the data into two or more subsets. This is typically done using measures like Gini impurity, information gain, or entropy.\n",
    "Decision Rules: The splitting process creates decision rules that split the data based on the chosen feature and threshold.\n",
    "Leaf Nodes: The process continues recursively, creating branches and further nodes, until the stopping criteria are met (e.g., all data points in a node belong to the same class, the maximum depth is reached, or the minimum number of samples per node is reached).\n",
    "Prediction: To make a prediction, the model traverses the tree from the root to a leaf node, following the decision rules at each node, and outputs the class label at the leaf node."
