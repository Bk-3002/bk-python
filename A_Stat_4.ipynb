    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. It is used for discrete random variables.\n",
    "Example: Consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF for each outcome \n",
    "𝑋\n",
    "X (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable to take on a particular value. It is used for continuous random variables. The area under the curve of a PDF over an interval represents the probability that the variable falls within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2.Cumulative Density Function (CDF):\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF of a random variable \n",
    "𝑋\n",
    "X is a function that gives the probability that \n",
    "𝑋\n",
    "X will take a value less than or equal to \n",
    "𝑥\n",
    "x. For a continuous random variable, it is the integral of the PDF. For a discrete random variable, it is the sum of the PMF.\n",
    "Why CDF is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is used to determine the probability that a random variable falls within a certain range. It is also useful for finding percentiles and quantiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "Examples of Situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Heights of individuals in a population.\n",
    "Measurement errors in scientific experiments.\n",
    "IQ scores.\n",
    "Daily stock market returns.\n",
    "Parameters and Shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (\n",
    "𝜇\n",
    "μ): Determines the center of the distribution. Shifting the mean shifts the distribution left or right.\n",
    "Standard Deviation (\n",
    "𝜎\n",
    "σ): Determines the spread of the distribution. A larger \n",
    "𝜎\n",
    "σ results in a wider and flatter distribution, while a smaller \n",
    "𝜎\n",
    "σ results in a narrower and taller distribution.\n",
    "Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "Importance of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is important because many natural phenomena tend to follow it. It also has desirable mathematical properties that make it useful in statistical analysis and inferential statistics. Many statistical tests assume normality due to the central limit theorem, which states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size increases.\n",
    "Real-life Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Heights of people.\n",
    "Blood pressure readings.\n",
    "Exam scores.\n",
    "Measurement errors in physical and engineering processes.\n",
    "Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution with only two possible outcomes: success (with probability 𝑝\n",
    " and failure (with probability 1−p). It models a single trial of a binary experiment.\n",
    "Example: Flipping a fair coin (success = heads, failure = tails).\n",
    "Difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution: Models a single trial with two possible outcomes.\n",
    "Binomial Distribution: Models the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success p.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: What is the Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem (CLT):\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLT states that the distribution of the sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population's distribution, provided the samples are independent and identically distributed.\n",
    "Significance:\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows for the use of normal distribution techniques in inferential statistics.\n",
    "It justifies the use of the normal distribution in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation.\n",
    "Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "The sample size should be sufficiently large (usually \n",
    "\n",
    "n>30 is considered adequate).\n",
    "Samples should be independent of each other.\n",
    "The data should be identically distributed (i.e., drawn from the same population distribution)."
